# Project Profile Plan — nostrmaxi-canonical

## Profile
- **Type:** SaaS/Portal
- **Profile:** A
- **Rationale:** Full foundation mandatory for identity/payments ops.

## Foundation Requirements
1. Admin console with dashboard + CRUD config
2. DB-backed config entities + system settings
3. Connector/plugin abstraction + factory
4. Execution engine (manual + scheduled) with history and alerts

## Next 3 Execution Tasks
1. Create/confirm foundation checklist in `_bmad-output/architecture/foundation-checklist.md`
2. Map existing components to profile requirements and identify gaps
3. Open a remediation sprint in `_bmad-output/sprints/` with explicit DoD

## Promotion Triggers (if applicable)
- Move to Profile A when multi-tenant operations, recurring ingest jobs, or non-dev admin configuration becomes necessary.
