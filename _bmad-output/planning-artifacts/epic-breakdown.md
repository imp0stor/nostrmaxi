## Dependencies Summary

**Critical Path:**
1. Epic 1 (NIP-05) → Epic 2 (Feeds) + Epic 3 (Profiles) → Epic 4 (Domains)
2. Epic 4 (Domains) → Epic 5 (Books) or Epic 7 (Shopping)
3. Epic 5 (Books) needs Blossom integration
4. Epic 6 (Gift Cards) + Epic 7 (Shopping) need Lightning + BTCPay
5. Epic 8 (Q&A) + Epic 9 (Bounties) need Profiles + Lightning

**Parallel Execution:**
- Epic 2 + Epic 3 (can build simultaneously)
- Epic 5 + Epic 6 (independent)
- Epic 8 + Epic 9 (similar tech stack)

**External Dependencies:**
- **Blossom:** Server availability, API stability
- **Lightning:** BTCPay uptime, liquidity
- **Nostr NIPs:** Standardization of book/gift card/shopping kinds
- **WoT Scoring:** Mature library or build in-house

---

## Estimated Timeline (Agentic Time)

**Phase 1 (Weeks 2-4):** Epics 2-4 (Feeds + Profiles + Domains) = 10-13 agent days  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Epics 5-7 (Books + Gift Cards + Shopping) = 14-17 agent days  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Epics 8-9 (Q&A + Bounties) = 8-10 agent days  

**Total:** 32-40 agent days (~6-8 calendar weeks with 5+ parallel agents)

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

| Risk Category | Mitigation |
|---------------|-----------|
| **External Service Downtime** | Multi-provider fallback (Blossom → S3, relay clusters) |
| **NIP Standardization Delays** | Ship with custom kinds, adapt when NIPs ratified |
| **Lightning Liquidity Issues** | Partner with custodial wallet (Alby, Wallet of Satoshi) |
| **Spam/Abuse** | WoT gating on all user-generated content |
| **Solo Founder Burnout** | Agent swarms for parallel work, ruthless automation |
