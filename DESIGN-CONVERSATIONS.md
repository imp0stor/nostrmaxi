CHIEF_ARCHITECT_LOOP (every 30m): architecture governance with project rotation + adaptive focus. 1) QMD/KB-first retrieval from latest status, requirements matrix, portfolio review docs, recent completion reports, QA knowledge entries, and runbook deltas. 2) Rotate primary focus each run across products (NostrCast, NostrMaxi, Beacon, Hive, Immortals, Fragstr). 3) If milestones/completions/blocker deltas are detected, override rotation and prioritize that product immediately. 4) RUNBOOK-FIRST GOVERNANCE: ensure each prioritized product has current cutover, rollback, and ops runbooks tied to shipped reality. 5) Enforce HARD CLOSURE GATE: no wave closes unless knowledge is gathered + recorded (sources + durable artifact + rollback + runbook update). 6) Update /home/owner/strangesignal/docs/status/CHIEF-ARCHITECT-LOOP-LATEST.md with top 5 leverage moves, blocker ownership, exact next commands, and refactor queue. 7) Keep recommendations reversible and execution-ready; if no meaningful delta, do nothing.

Adaptive focus override triggered: although rotation would have moved to Beacon, I prioritized **NostrMaxi** because a meaningful completion delta landed (`NOSTRMAXI-SCOPE-RECOVERY-WAVE3-VALIDATION-2026-02-17.md`, 14:09 EST) showing smoke tests + frontend build PASS and shippable validation evidence.

What was enforced in this loop:
- QMD/KB-first retrieval across project status, requirements matrix, portfolio review, completion reports, promise registry, and runbook standards.
- Runbook-first governance check for prioritized product:
