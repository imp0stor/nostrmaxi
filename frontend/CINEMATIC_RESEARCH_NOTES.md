# Cinematic Polish Pass – Competitive Research Notes

## Damus (iOS)
- Minimal information density; strong typography hierarchy with generous spacing.
- Action surfaces stay quiet until needed (contextual controls).
- Consistent card rhythm keeps scanning effortless.

## Primal (web/mobile)
- Modern social feed uses compact controls + strong contrast for primary actions.
- Subtle gradient accents and polished interaction states communicate quality.
- Side/inline panels for context without overwhelming feed focus.

## Amethyst (Android)
- Feature-rich UI works by grouping advanced controls into expandable sections.
- Explicit labels for power settings reduce ambiguity.
- Dense controls become usable when chunked into small modules.

## Discord
- Dark theme layering: base background + raised panels + highlighted active states.
- Navigation hierarchy is obvious at a glance (global nav, context nav, content).
- Motion is subtle but informative (hover, selected, unread states).

## Notion
- Accordion/collapse behavior is predictable and forgiving.
- Progressive disclosure: summary first, details on demand.
- Consistent touch targets and spacing improve mobile usability.

## Linear
- Cinematic modern SaaS aesthetic: deep surfaces, clean gradients, restrained glow.
- Fast-feeling transitions (not flashy) create premium polish.
- Tight typography system and micro-interaction consistency elevate perceived quality.

## Patterns applied to NostrMaxi
1. **Progressive disclosure everywhere practical** (collapsed by default, summary visible).
2. **Clear action hierarchy** (primary gradient CTA, secondary neutral chips).
3. **Layered dark surfaces** (base, panel, focused card) with subtle blur/depth shadows.
4. **Sleek motion profile** (300-400ms ease-out, slight scale on hover).
5. **Mobile-first control ergonomics** (44px min tap targets and wrapped control rows).
