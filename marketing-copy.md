## FAQ

### What is NIP-05?

NIP-05 is Nostr's verification standard. It links your Nostr pubkey to a human-readable identifier (like `name@domain.com`), making you easier to find and trust.

Think of it like Twitter's blue check, but decentralized and actually meaningful.

### Why NostrMaxi vs other NIP-05 providers?

Most NIP-05 services sell you an identity and stop there. We're building a full creator platform — feeds, profiles, publishing tools, e-commerce.

Plus, we offer multiple domains (nostrmaxi.com, strangesignal.ai, strange.news) and BYOD support.

### Can I bring my own domain?

Yes! Creator and Studio tiers support custom domains. You'll get DNS instructions and verification support.

### Do I own my identity if I leave?

Your Nostr identity (npub) is always yours. The NIP-05 identifier is tied to the domain. If you bring your own domain, you control it forever. If you use ours and leave, the identifier stops working, but your npub + content remain yours.

### What payment methods do you accept?

Bitcoin (Lightning or on-chain) via BTCPay. Credit cards coming soon.

### Can I cancel anytime?

Yes. No contracts, no tricks. Cancel from your dashboard whenever you want.

### What's coming next? (Roadmap)

**Phase 1 (Weeks 2-4):** Feed generation, profile management, domain hosting  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Book authorship, gift cards, shopping  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Q&A platform, bug bounties, reviews  
**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Fundraising, marketplace

See full roadmap: [/roadmap]

### Who built this?

NostrMaxi is built by [Strange Signal](https://strangesignal.ai) — a team obsessed with Nostr-native infrastructure.

We're creators building for creators. Open source when possible. Sovereignty always.

## About Page (Optional)

### Mission

**Make Nostr accessible to creators.**

Nostr is powerful, but fragmented. Developers build amazing primitives, but adoption stalls because creators lack tools.

NostrMaxi bridges that gap. We package identity, feeds, publishing, commerce — everything a creator needs — into one simple platform.

No lock-in. No platform rent-seeking. Just tools that work.

### Why We Built This

The internet broke when platforms became landlords.

Creators don't need permission to build on Nostr. But they do need infrastructure. NostrMaxi is that infrastructure.

We believe:
- **Identity should be portable** (NIP-05, not platform handles)
- **Content should be owned** (Nostr events, not platform databases)
- **Tools should be composable** (Nostr primitives, not proprietary APIs)

### Open Source

Core primitives (NIP libraries, feed algorithms, WoT scoring) are open source.

The platform itself is source-available (not fully open source — we need to eat).

We contribute upstream to Nostr NIPs and ecosystem projects.

### Reddit Post (r/nostr, r/bitcoin)

**Title:** Launched NostrMaxi — NIP-05 + creator tools for Nostr

Hey r/nostr,

I just launched **NostrMaxi** (nostrmaxi.com) — a platform for Nostr creators who want more than just an identity.

**What it does:**
- NIP-05 verification on multiple domains (nostrmaxi.com, strangesignal.ai, strange.news, or BYOD)
- Curated feeds with WoT filtering
- Rich profiles with endorsements
- Publishing tools (books, stores, gift cards — roadmap)

**Why I built it:**
Nostr has amazing primitives, but they're scattered. Creators shouldn't need to cobble together 5 services. NostrMaxi gives you everything in one place.

**Pricing:** $9/mo Creator, $29/mo Studio. Bitcoin payments (Lightning + on-chain).

**Open to feedback!** This is v1. Tell me what you need.
